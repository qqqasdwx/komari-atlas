# Komari-Next

Komari-Next is a modern frontend for the Komari monitoring project.  
It is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** and packaged as a static site that can be used as a Komari theme.

[Demo](https://komari.probe.name)

[Download theme file](https://github.com/tonyliuzj/komari-next/releases/latest/download/dist-release.zip)

> This repository contains only the frontend. You will need a running Komari backend instance for the UI to talk to. Or you can download the theme file and upload it through Komari's admin dashboard, this would be the recommanded way.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, static export)
- **Language:** TypeScript, React
- **UI:** Shadcn UI + Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **State / Data:** Custom contexts, RPC2 client, fetch-based APIs

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22 or newer (LTS recommended)
- A running **Komari backend** (API) reachable from the browser

## Getting Started

- Simply [download theme file](https://github.com/tonyliuzj/komari-next/releases/latest/download/dist-release.zip) and upload it through Komari's admin dashboard, this would be the recommanded way.

## Dev

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

### Configure API target

The frontend talks to the Komari backend via `/api/*` rewrites configured in `next.config.ts`.  
Set the backend base URL using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TARGET`:

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:25774
```

Adjust the URL to point to your Komari backend instance.

### Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Build for production / theme packaging

This project is configured for static export (`output: "export"` in `next.config.ts`), with the build output written to `dist/`.

```bash
npm run build
```

After the build completes:

- Serve the `dist` directory with any static web server, **or**
- Use the contents of `dist` as part of a Komari theme bundle.

## Nginx Production Optimization Tips

If you use Nginx or OpenResty as a reverse proxy, consider the following configuration to improve performance and avoid 404 responses for `HEAD` requests.

### 1. Handle HEAD requests (recommended)

Next.js prefetching and some CDNs, such as Tencent Cloud EdgeOne, may send frequent HTTP `HEAD` requests. Because the backend may not fully handle `HEAD`, you can convert those requests to `GET` at the Nginx layer before proxying them upstream:

```nginx
location / {
    # Convert HEAD to GET before proxying upstream to avoid prefetch 404s.
    if ($request_method = "HEAD") {
        rewrite_by_lua_block { ngx.req.set_method(ngx.HTTP_GET) } # OpenResty option
        # Or use: proxy_method GET; (pay attention to directive placement)
    }

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:25774;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

### 2. Enable Gzip compression

Gzip can significantly improve the loading speed of Next.js static assets:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml;
gzip_vary on;
```

### 3. Security hardening

Consider using `fail2ban` to monitor Nginx logs and block large-scale malicious scans against paths such as `/api/rpc2` or `/instance/`.

These settings can improve navigation smoothness, make deployments more compatible with CDNs such as EdgeOne and Cloudflare, and reduce invalid 404 noise in browser consoles and Nginx logs.

## Theme Development

This repository is designed to be used as a custom Komari theme.

1. Configure and customize the UI as needed.
2. Edit `komari-theme.json` to match your theme’s metadata and settings.
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. The static assets will be generated in the `dist` directory.  
   Combine them with `komari-theme.json` as required by Komari’s theme system and package them according to the Komari documentation.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start the Next.js development server
- `npm run build` – Build the static site into `dist/`
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint over the project
- `npm run typecheck` – Check TypeScript without emitting files
- `npm test` – Run the Vitest unit tests once
- `npm run preview` – Serve the generated `dist/` directory locally
